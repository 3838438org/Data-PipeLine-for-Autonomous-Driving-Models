# Data-PipeLine-for-Autonomous-Driving-Models
This is my mini project in which I will be using the Udacity Open Sourced Data[https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/datasets] for my dataset. Apart from this I'll be trying to make a pipeline around this dataset so that I will learn the basic infrastructure pipeline models in Industry.
